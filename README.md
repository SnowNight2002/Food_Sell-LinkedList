# Food_Sell-LinkedList
Student A plans to run a food stall in the IT Carnival,<br />
which is a campus event to be held for one week. <br />
Only limited food and drinks will be available for sale during the carnival. <br />
Student A will be responsible for preparing food and drinks while another student will be employed as a cashier. <br />
Student A is now developing a program to simulate the operation <br />
of food stall in order to assess the adequacy of manpower in varying sales volume.<br />
